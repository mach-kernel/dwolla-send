# dwolla-send
A quickstart tutorial application written in Rails 4 + bootstrap to illustrate the send UX flow, without the traditional `https://dwolla.com` environment. 

Syntax highlighting done via [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge).

## Requirements
- Rails 4+
- Bundler

This application does not require any database access as all the data is processed via the Dwolla API. ActiveRecord has been removed from this project. 

## Getting Started

### The easy way

The default application key and secret bundled with the application are for you to use with the UAT environment, so you can just run it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mach-kernel/dwolla-send.git
cd dwolla-send
bundle install && rails s
```

Afterwards, just visit your default Rails URL, which is probably `localhost:3000`.

### Hurt me plenty

Just kidding. The only thing that you would really need to configure are the `dwolla-ruby` variables. You can find everything that you need in `config/initializers/dwollavars.rb`

```ruby
require 'dwolla'

module DwollaVars
	mattr_reader  :Dwolla, :pin

	@@Dwolla ||= Dwolla
	
	@@Dwolla::api_key ||= nil
	@@Dwolla::api_secret ||= nil

	@@Dwolla::token ||= nil
	@@pin ||= nil

	@@Dwolla::sandbox ||= true
end
```

**Note**: These values cannot be edited on-the-fly (except from within a `rails c` session) and require a restart of the rails server. 

## Deploy to Heroku

Heroku is in the name of the repo, right?

### Requirements

- A [Heroku](https://heroku.com) account with an available instance.
- The [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed to your local machine (and added to your `%PATH%` variable if you are a Windows user).
- I recommend forking this repository so that you can have write privileges. 

### How-to deploy: the easy-peasy way

*Please* fork this repository before doing this.

1. Connect your GitHub account in your Heroku admin panel

2. Search for your repository

3. Deploy a branch

### How-to deploy: the devops special

1. Log in
    ```bash
    heroku login
    
    Enter your Heroku credentials.
    Email: you@example.com
    Password:
    Could not find an existing public key.
    Would you like to generate one? [Yn]
    Generating new SSH public key.
    Uploading ssh public key /Users/david/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

2. Install Rails
    ```bash
    gem install rails
    ```

3. Add Heroku gem, change `redirect`

    I would have done this for you, but this is more fun!
    
    ```bash
    echo "gem 'rails_12factor'" >> Gemfile
    bundle install
    ```

4. Drop back to your local machine's shell and change to the application directory

    This will add a heroku branch to the git repository
    
    ```bash
    heroku create
    Creating dwolla-rails-heroku... done, stack is cedar-14
    https://dwolla-rails-heroku.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/dwolla-rails-heroku.git
    Git remote heroku added
    ```

And finally, deploy and run.

```bash
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

That wasn't so bad, was it?
